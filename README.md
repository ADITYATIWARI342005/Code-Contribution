<h1>What is hactoberfest?</h1>
<p>Hacktoberfest is an annual event that encourages contributions to open-source projects on platforms like GitHub. It takes place throughout the month of October. The main goal of Hacktoberfest is to promote open-source collaboration and community participation by rewarding contributors with limited-edition swag, such as t-shirts and stickers, for making a certain number of valid pull requests to open-source repositories.</p>
